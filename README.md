# treat-or-target
Machine learning meets causal targeting in digital marketing.
Traditional classifiers predict who will convert â€” but not why. This project implements uplift modeling using the Criteo Uplift Dataset to predict incremental impact: identifying users who respond because of a marketing treatment. Using Solo, Two-Model, and LGWUM approaches, we simulate smarter campaign targeting and visualize the performance of each method in terms of gain, deciles, and uplift score distribution.
